        // silhouette sampled a bevel's width to either side. That difference
        // *cancels* wherever a stroke is narrower than twice the bevel — both
        // samples land outside it — so thin strokes and tight curves carry no
        // rim at all, and only the broad parts are outlined. That is the
        // sketched quality the face is liked for.
        //
        // Reading the distance field directly instead — "is this pixel within
        // a bevel of the edge" — has no such cancellation: it lights every
        // thin stroke solid white, and the rims that should sit either side
        // of one merge into a single band. So the original computation is
        // kept, taken on the silhouette the field reconstructs rather than on
        // a coverage mask.
        //
        // How far to reach is the one thing the field has to supply. Its
        // gradient has unit length wherever it is still ramping, so the
        // spread it was built with — and with it the nine texels this bevel
        // used to be, as a fraction of an em — follows from the gradient's
        // magnitude in texels. That is what keeps the bevel the same share of
