// (photo there - photo here) to what the effect drew here, which only holds
// while the effect shows the photo as it is. Once the effect has dimmed,
// blurred or replaced the photo, nothing is left to cancel that difference and
// it lands in the digit as raw photo colour: where blue sky meets a brown wall
// under a digit, the digit showed brown, or a blue the frame never had,
// against a lock screen dimmed to black. So each layer's difference is taken
// only as strongly as that layer shows here.
//
// How strongly each layer shows at this pixel, filled in by main() before the

// halftone) the clock is drained with it, frame by frame through the
// transition. Only the colour goes, never the brightness: a clock that dimmed
// with the screen would vanish into it.
//

// this pixel, 0 (none) .. 1 (all of it).

// gradient over a few texels, so the bevel costs no extra texture and no CPU
// work per frame.

    // always had; what has changed is where the bevel comes from. It used to
    // be a difference of the coverage mask taken nine texels apart, which is
    // a band of fixed pixel width — so it thickened or thinned with whatever
    // resolution the face happened to be rasterised at. Measured off the
    // field instead, it is the same fraction of a stroke at every size.

        //
        // This face has always taken its bevel as the difference of the
        // silhouette sampled a bevel's width to either side. That difference
        // *cancels* wherever a stroke is narrower than twice the bevel — both
        // samples land outside it — so thin strokes and tight curves carry no
        // rim at all, and only the broad parts are outlined. That is the
        // sketched quality the face is liked for.
        //
        // Reading the distance field directly instead — "is this pixel within
        // a bevel of the edge" — has no such cancellation: it lights every
        // thin stroke solid white, and the rims that should sit either side
        // of one merge into a single band. So the original computation is
        // kept, taken on the silhouette the field reconstructs rather than on
        // a coverage mask.
        //
        // How far to reach is the one thing the field has to supply. Its
        // gradient has unit length wherever it is still ramping, so the
        // spread it was built with — and with it the nine texels this bevel
        // used to be, as a fraction of an em — follows from the gradient's
        // magnitude in texels. That is what keeps the bevel the same share of
        // a stroke at any rasterisation, which the fixed nine texels were not.

        // strokes meet the gradient collapses on the ridge between them. The
        // reach below is derived from that gradient, so an unfaded corner
